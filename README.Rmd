# rODE

The goal of rODE is to explore R and its S4 classes and their differences with Java and Python while exploring simulations by solving differential equations.

`rODE` is based in the extraordinary physics library for computer simulations OpenSourcePhyisics. Tae a look at http://opensourcephysics.org.

The ODE solvers implemented in R so far:

* Euler
* Euler-Richardson
* RK4
* RK45, Dormand-Prince45
* Verlet


## Installation

You can install rODE from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AlfonsoRReyes/rODE")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```
