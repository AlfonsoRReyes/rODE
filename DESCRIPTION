Title: Ordinary Differential Equation Solvers Written in R using S4 classes
Version: 0.1.5

Description: The objective of this package is to show Physics students how
     an ODE solver is made and how effective classes can be for the equation
     construction. Most of the ideas come from the book on Computer Simulations
     in Physics by Wolfgang Christian et al.
